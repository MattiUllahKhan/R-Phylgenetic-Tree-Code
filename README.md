# R-Phylgenetic-Tree-Code
This repo provides different codes that may you use as template for your research or educational purpose

These below R package provides advanced functions for constructing phylogenetic trees from sequence data. It leverages the power of various R packages, including:

* `msa`: For multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of your input sequences.
* `seqinr`: For sequence manipulation tasks, including reading FASTA/qual files and working with DNA/protein sequences.
* `phangorn`: For advanced phylogenetic analyses, offering diverse tree building algorithms and distance measures.
* `ape`: For convenient manipulation of phylogenetic trees, visualization, and further analysis.

**Key Functionalities:**

* **Data Input and Preprocessing:**
    - Read FASTA/qual sequence files using `read.fasta` or `read.qual` from `seqinr`.
    - Perform quality control and filtering (if necessary) using functions from `seqinr`.
* **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):**
    - Employ advanced alignment algorithms from `msa` for accurate sequence alignment, considering factors like substitution matrices and gap penalties.
    - Explore options like `clustalw` or more sophisticated methods like `MUSCLE` or `MAFFT`.
* **Distance Matrix Calculation:**
    - Calculate appropriate distance matrices using functions like `dist.hamming`, `dist.euclidean`, or others from `ape` depending on your data type (DNA, protein, etc.).
    - Consider advanced distance measures from `phangorn` like Jukes-Cantor or Kimura-2-Parameter for nucleotide sequences.
* **Tree Building Algorithms:**
    - Construct phylogenetic trees using various algorithms from `phangorn`:
        - **Distance-based methods:** Neighbor-joining (NJ) with `nj` or `upgma`, Minimum Evolution (ME) with `me`.
        - **Maximum Likelihood (ML) method:** Use `ml` with appropriate substitution models from `phangorn`.
        - **Bayesian inference (optional):** Explore packages like `mcmc.glmm` for more complex analyses (not covered in detail here).
* **Tree Manipulation and Visualization:**
    - Utilize functions from `ape` to manipulate trees (e.g., rooting, re-scaling), calculate branch lengths, and perform ancestral sequence reconstruction.
    - Create informative visualizations using `plot` or other plotting functions from `ape` or external libraries like `ggplot2`.
* **Advanced Analyses (Optional):**
    - Explore functionalities from `phangorn` for:
        - Phylogenetic distance estimation (`daisy`)
        - Tree comparison (`compare.trees`)
        - Ancestral sequence reconstruction (`ancestral`)
    - Consider integrating other R packages for specific needs (e.g., `data.table` for efficient data manipulation, `parallel` for parallelization).

**Getting Started**

1. **Installation:** Install the required packages using `install.packages(c("msa", "seqinr", "phangorn", "ape"))`.
2. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your sequence data in FASTA/qual format.
3. **Load Packages:** Load the necessary packages: `library(msa); library(seqinr); library(phangorn); library(ape)`.
4. **Example Workflow:**

```R
# Read FASTA sequences
sequences <- read.fasta("your_sequences.fasta")

# Perform MSA (replace with your preferred method)
msa <- clustalw(sequences)

# Calculate distance matrix (adjust based on data type)
distance_matrix <- dist.hamming(msa)

# Build phylogenetic tree (choose appropriate algorithm)
tree <- nj(distance_matrix)

# Plot and visualize the tree
plot(tree, main="Phylogenetic Tree")
